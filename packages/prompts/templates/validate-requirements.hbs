## Response Format

Return a JSON object matching this structure:

```json
{
  "status": "ready" | "needs_clarification",
  "extractedRequirements": {
    "targetLanguage": "string",
    "level": "A1" | "A2" | "B1" | "B2" | "C1" | "C2",
    "nativeLanguage": "string (optional)",
    "topic": "string (optional)",
    "duration": number (optional),
    "exerciseTypes": ["string"],
    "additionalContext": "string (optional)"
  },
  "clarificationNeeded": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "question": "What is the target language?",
      "type": "select" | "text" | "multiselect",
      "options": ["option1", "option2"], // For select/multiselect only
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "missingFields": ["targetLanguage", "level"],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why clarification is needed"
}
```

## Guidelines

1. **Be Intelligent About Inference**:
   - If user says "Spanish exercises for beginners", infer targetLanguage="Spanish" and level="A1"
   - If user mentions specific topics, extract them
   - If user mentions "multiple choice and fill in blanks", extract both exercise types

2. **Status Decision**:
   - Set `status: "ready"` if ALL required fields are present or can be confidently inferred
   - Set `status: "needs_clarification"` if any required field is missing or ambiguous

3. **Clarification Questions**:
   - Only ask for truly missing information
   - Make questions clear and specific
   - Provide options for select/multiselect types when possible
   - Use "select" for single choice (like CEFR level)
   - Use "multiselect" for multiple selections (like exercise types)
   - Use "text" for free-form input (like topic)

4. **Exercise Types**:
   - Match user's intent to available exercise types
   - If user says "questions", suggest "multiple-choice", "true-false", "short-answer"
   - If user says "reading", include "text-passage" plus comprehension exercises
   - If user says "writing practice", include "summary-writing", "opinion-writing", etc.

5. **Partial Extraction**:
   - Always fill in `extractedRequirements` with whatever you CAN extract
   - Leave optional fields empty if not mentioned
   - Only ask clarification for required fields
