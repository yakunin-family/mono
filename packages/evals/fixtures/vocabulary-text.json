It is home to an extraordinary diversity of marine life, from microscopic plankton to magnificent whales.</p><p id=\"p-body1\">Coral reefs are particularly fascinating ecosystems. These underwater structures are built by tiny organisms called coral polyps. They provide shelter and sustenance for countless species of fish and invertebrates.</p><p id=\"p-body2\">Unfortunately, rising ocean temperatures and pollution are threatening these delicate habitats. Many scientists are now dedicated to studying ways to preserve and restore coral reef ecosystems around the globe.</p><p id=\"p-body3\">The deep ocean remains largely unexplored. Researchers continue to discover remarkable species that have adapted to withstand the extreme pressure and darkness of the ocean floor.</p></lesson>",
