# Check Hypothesis: AI Tooling Demand

Validate the hypothesis: **"Tutors want AI-assisted content creation"**

## Hypothesis

Language tutors have demand for AI-powered tools that help them create educational content faster. This could include:

- Auto-generating exercises from text
- Converting images of worksheets into interactive exercises
- Suggesting content based on student level and topic
- Translation assistance

## Validation Approach

- [ ] Interview 5-10 language tutors about their content creation workflow
- [ ] Ask about pain points in lesson preparation
- [ ] Gauge interest in AI-assisted features
- [ ] Understand concerns (accuracy, over-reliance, etc.)

## Key Questions

1. How much time do you spend creating lesson content vs teaching?
2. What's the most tedious part of content creation?
3. Would you trust AI to help create exercises? Why or why not?
4. What AI features would be most valuable to you?

## Success Criteria

- At least 60% of interviewed tutors express interest in AI content creation features
- Clear understanding of which AI features are most valued
- Identified concerns and objections to address in product design
