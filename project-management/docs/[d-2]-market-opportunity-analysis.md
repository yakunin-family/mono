# Market Opportunity Analysis

**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Product:** Collaborative lesson editor for language tutors (Notion-like block editor with language-learning components + CMS)
**Target Market:** Europe
**Stage:** Pre-launch/MVP

---

## Executive Summary

We're building an **interactive lesson delivery platform** for private language tutors - think "Notion meets interactive classroom." The platform enables tutors to create, store, and deliver lessons with specialized language-learning components (exercises, fill-in-blanks, vocabulary tools) while students interact with content in real-time through their own accounts.

| Metric | Value | Timeframe |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **TAM** | €40-60M | Annual (Europe) |
| **SAM** | €8-15M | Annual |
| **SOM** | €200K-500K | Year 3 |
| **SOM** | €500K-1.2M | Year 5 |

**Key insight:** Our direct competitor Edvibe/ProgressMe claims 50,000+ language teachers. At their ~$5-10/month effective ARPU, this suggests a proven market of €3-6M ARR already captured by one player alone - validating demand.
