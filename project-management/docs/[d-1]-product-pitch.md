# Product Pitch

## The Pitch (30-second version)

**"Language tutors piece together Zoom, Google Docs, whiteboards, messaging apps - none built for teaching. I'm building a modern workspace for online language tutors: prep lessons faster, run interactive sessions, and manage homework - all in one place."**

---

## Core Problem

Tutors can only earn money when they're teaching. But content admin (formatting, organizing, assembling lessons) eats into that time.

**Less admin time = more teaching time = more income.**

On top of that, the tools they use (Google Docs, whiteboards, screen sharing, Discord) weren't designed for live teaching:

* Hard for students to follow when tutors jump around documents
* Clunky placeholder hacks (deleting `_______` to type answers)
* Homework managed through comment threads

---

## The Solution

A workspace designed specifically for how online language tutors actually work:

1. **Prep** - Organize and reuse content, so lesson prep takes minutes instead of hours
2. **Teach** - Purpose-built editor with interactive components for language learning
3. **Assign** - Homework management that isn't a comment thread hack

## Positioning

* **Enemy:** General-purpose tools cobbled together
* **Differentiator:** Modern, purpose-built for language tutors, AI-native
* **Tone:** Confident but not aggressive toward competitors
